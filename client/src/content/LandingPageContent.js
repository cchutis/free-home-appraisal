            <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>Are you thinking about selling your current house? Do you want to
            purchase a new home? Or, maybe you just want to refinance while
            interest rates are low? Whatever the case, you will need a property
            appraisal to determine the value of the home or property in
            question. At FreeHomeAppraisal.com, we understand that estimating
            the price of a house or property can be a painful process and so we
            opted to make home appraisals free and easy to use. We calculate
            property prices using a highly-efficient proprietary algorithm that
            takes recent comparable sales, specific property information and
            neighborhood data into account when creating a broad property
            valuation estimate.</p>
